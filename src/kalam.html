            APJ Abdul Kalam’s Childhood and Early Life
        </h3>
        <p>
            Abdul Kalam had to struggle a lot to reach the success he has achieved in his career.<br>
            He has been a live manifestation of the strength he describes in this quote.<br>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam or A.P.J Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October, 1931 to a humble Tamil
            Muslim family.<br>
            He had to sell newspapers his his childhood in order to manage the finances of the family.<br>
            He was an average student in school but his keen interest in studies and his hard work are what helped him
            achieve success in his career.<br>

            Kalam graduated in Physics from Tiruchirapalli’s St Joseph’s College, which was affiliated with the
            University of Madras, in 1954.<br>
            In the year 1955, Kalam pursued Aerospace Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology.<br>
            Kalam wanted to become a fighter pilot for IAF but missed the opportunity as there were only eight positions
            and Kalam qualified ninth.<br>

            Kalam’s journey to become the ‘missile man of India’ had its trials and tribulations and yet he attained his
            goal because of his singleminded devotion.<br>
            After he completed his engineering, he joined DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment as a scientist.<br>
            He also designed a helicopter for the Indian Army in the beginning of his career.<br>
            Kalam was still not sure of his career choice.<br>
            In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).<br>
            In ISRO, he headed the project of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III).<br>
            The growth of Kalam began here from a mere scientist to become the missile man of India itself.<br>
            He headed several successful launches and started gaining recognition in relevant circles.<br>
